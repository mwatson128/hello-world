Hello!

I like Python and have the most experience in C.  I detest Java because of all of the boilerplate crap you have to use all of the time.  After programming in python for a while now I find it tedious to have to end statements with a semi-colon.  Maybe I would like golang; it does not end statements with a semi-colon.
